# number_guesser
This is my very first Python project
I understand it is simple, but the computer picks a number between 1 and 10, and the user guesses it.

# features
  -Currently only easy mode 1-10
  -Plan to add hard mode 1-100, as well as extreme mode, which is 1-10 but with a float .00
  -You get a hint after 5 guesses
  -It keeps track of your attempts

# How to run
  1. Download the file
  2. Run it with Python
